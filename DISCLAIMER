The data used for the generation of the DocXPand-25k dataset are not personal data in the meaning of GDPR as they are not related to an identified or identifiable natural person. They are test data generated through Faker, Stable Diffusion v1.5 and Quicksign anomyzed scene images. The photos of faces are generated through an AI system. Therefore, the application of GDPR is excluded. Should personal data in the meaning of GDPR be used through the algorithm, an assessment should be made to evaluate the conformity of the data processing with GDPR.
The ID designs used to generate the DocXPand-25k dataset and other fictitious ID documents in the DocXPand-25k are fictitious ID and could not be assimilated to forgery ID. 
The purpose of the DocXPand-25k and the algorithm is to provide a dataset and a algorithm to generate fictitious ID documents to train on document localization, text recognition but not fraud detection as the fictitious ID documents could not be assimilated to valid ID documents.
QuickSign disclaims all responsibility for the use of the DocXPand-25k dataset and the associated code
